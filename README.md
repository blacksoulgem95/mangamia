# Manga Mia

Manga Mia is a self-hosted solution for managing your manga collection on your NAS / HomeLab.
It is designed to organize, enrich, and convert your manga archives with ease. Built on Node.js, 
Manga Mia simplifies manga management by handling metadata, archive formats, and directory structures.

As all the apps I tried were failing me in some way or another, I decided to build my own, だってばね!

## The name:
Manga Mia is a wordplay based on the italian exclamation "Mamma mia!" 
(Oh my mother!, in english a common equivalent is "Oh my.." "Oh my God!").

## Features

- **Organize Manga:**
  - Automatically organize manga into subfolders based on metadata.

- **Metadata Management:**
  - Generate and edit metadata for individual manga archives.
  - Supports common metadata standards for manga readers.

- **Format Conversion:**
  - Convert manga archives to CBR or CBZ formats.
  - Generate the necessary metadata files for seamless reading.

  - Run Manga Mia on your NAS or any server environment supporting Node.js.

## Development Status

Manga Mia is currently under development. Features, installation instructions, and requirements will be updated as the project progresses.
